PROJECT TITLE: Daily Student Attendance Analyzer

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

We wish to solve the problem of tracking attendance in places such as schools and workplaces.

This can help keep track of employee attendance, which is important for things such as pay and observing work ethic.

This also helps keep track of student attendance, which affects things like learning and discipline.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES:
* Analyze and summarize the daily attendance data. 

* Present insights clearly to help users understand easily

* Practice and apply core Python and JSON techniques

PLANNED FEATURES:
On average, how many students are present per day?

Which date had the lowest attendance overall?

What type of absence occurred the most? (Tardy, Cut Class, Absent-Excused, Absent - Unexcused)

Which date had the highest attendance overall?

On average, how many students are absent per day?

PLANNED INPUTS AND OUTPUTS:

Inputs: a number for the feature the user wants to use(Ex. 1 for average present students per day, 2 for the date with lowest attendance, etc.)

If the user wants to add to the data set (ex. attendance for a new week, attendance of a new students) input the student id, name, and dates.

Outputs: Average attendance and absences, Most common type of Absence, and days with the lowest and highest attendances.
